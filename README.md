### Hi there, I'm Sahithyan.

I am a 16 year old developer who codes for fun and as a hobby.  
My main interest is frontend web development. I love to work with JavaScript and TypeScript.       
Most of my projects are made with Node.js.  
Although I love working in a familiar environment, I always love to try out new technologies and want to continue learning and improving my skills.  
  
I'm up for collaboration, so if you have an interesting project in mind, feel free to contact me :)  


### What I'm currently working on:
- [Honey Tree](https://github.com/sahithyandev/honey-tree), which is a CLI tool to create, share & use project boilerplates code without any headaches.
  
If you want to reach me, you can [send me an E-Mail.](mailto:sahithyan2701@gmail.com)
